        "TITLE": "Football freestyle",
        "ABOUT": "Freestyle in Ukraine is popular among children, teenagers and youth. There are so many people willing to undergo training in football tricks that we decided to open a football freestyle school. By signing up for classes, you will be able to jump into this sport, and who knows, you might be a rising star.",
        "STUDY": "Football freestyle training is available to everyone, you just need a little patience and persistent striving for the goal. First you need to prepare for classes:",
        "UNIQ": "There will be unique courses on: football freestyle, panna, football technique, tactical principles, positional literacy and much more.",

        "REMEMBER": "Remember that filigree technique, and in general a high level of playing football, is the product of a large number of hours of independent work, and not just team training. Ronaldinho was hitting the ball in a hotel room after the World Cup matches. Ronaldo stayed after training and practiced his punches for an hour. Cruyff mentioned that while playing for the Ajax kids' team 4-5 hours a week, he spent 15-20 hours outside, and that was where his technique was formed."
